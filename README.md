### Introdction

Deep learning will change front-end development in the coming years. It will increase prototyping speed and lower the barrier for building software. Such has been the claim by a number of ML Scientists and Practitioners. The field took off last year when Tony Beltramelli introduced the pix2code paper. 

Currently, the largest barrier to automating front-end development is computing power. However, we can use current deep learning algorithms, along with synthesized training data, to start exploring artificial front-end automation.
This model is our attempt to teach a neural network to code a basic HTML and CSS website based on a picture of a design mockup.

The neural network is built in three iterations. Starting with a Hello World version, followed by the main neural network layers, and ending by training it to generalize. The code is written in Python and Keras, a framework on top of TensorFlow.

### Installation

> pip install keras tensorflow pillow h5py jupyter
 
> git clone https://github.com/JotwaniNitin/Website-Generator.git 

> cd Screenshot-to-code/ jupyter notebook 
 
Now the run the model by running the ipynb files in jupyter notebook.
